DNS:
	- Domain Name System
	- Links names to IP addresses. 
	- It works on the public internet and on private networks 

How it works:
	- When you point your browser to http://localhost:5050/ (pgadmin) 
	- You’re using a domain name, which gets resolved to an IP address for one of the Docker servers 
	- Your machine actually fetches content using the IP address,
	- You, as the user, work with the domain name, which is much friendlier.

Docker has its own DNS service built in: 
- Apps running in containers make domain lookups when they try to access other components. 
- DNS service in Docker performs that lookup
	- If the domain name is actually a container name
		Docker returns the container’s IP address

	- If the domain name isn’t a container:
		Docker passes the request on to the server where Docker is running, 
		so it will make a standard DNS lookup to find an IP address on your organization’s network or the public internet.
